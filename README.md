Face Recognition in Python
This repository contains a Python script that performs face detection and recognition using OpenCV. The script utilizes pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces in an image and can be extended for facial recognition tasks.

🚀 Features
Detect faces in images using OpenCV.
Highlight detected faces with bounding boxes.
Easy-to-extend codebase for integrating facial recognition models.
Works with pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers.
🛠 Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed before running the code:

Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy
An image file (e.g., image.jpg) for testing.
📂 File Structure
detface.py: Main Python script for face detection.
image.jpg: Sample image for testing.
README.md: Documentation for the repository.
🧑‍💻 How to Use
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition.git
cd face-recognition
Place Your Test Image:

Save your image (e.g., image.jpg) in the same directory as the script.
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python detface.py
View Results:

The script will open a window displaying the input image with bounding boxes around detected faces.
Console output will show the number of faces detected.
🔑 Code Overview
Here’s a high-level breakdown of the key parts of the script:

Loading the Image:

python
Copy code
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
Face Detection:

python
Copy code
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_image, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
Drawing Bounding Boxes:

python
Copy code
for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
🧪 Example Output
Console Output:

scss
Copy code
Detected 2 face(s).
Image Output: Bounding boxes drawn around detected faces in the image.

🔧 Customization
Adjust Detection Parameters: Modify the parameters of detectMultiScale for improved results:

scaleFactor: Controls the image scaling.
minNeighbors: Adjusts how many neighbors each rectangle needs to retain.
minSize: Defines the minimum size of the face to be detected.
Extend for Recognition: Integrate libraries like dlib or face_recognition for face recognition tasks.

📝 Notes
The script relies on Haar Cascade Classifiers, which work best with frontal face images.
For improved accuracy, consider using deep learning-based models such as DNN or face_recognition.
