# Face Recognition in Python

This repository contains a Python script that performs face recognition using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier. The script detects faces in an image and highlights them with bounding boxes.

## Features
- Detects faces in an image using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Provides a simple and reusable function for face detection.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed before running the script:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`pip install opencv-python`)
- An image file (e.g., `image.jpg`)

## Installation
Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-python.git
-  cd face-recognition-python
